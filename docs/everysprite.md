# Every Sprite in the Game
This is an incredibly stupid way of doing this, but it was the quickest way. On the following six pages, each with 2030+ images, you can see every frame of every sprite in the game. There's no particularly good way to use this list, but here's how the files are named.
___
![spr_lv23_activated_14.png](images/everysprite/spr_lv23_activated_14.png)<br>spr_lv23_activated_14.png<br>
___
`spr_lv23_activated_14.png`

This is the filename that exported when I dumped every sprite in the game with UndertaleModTool.

**spr_lv23_activated**_14.png

The bolded part refers to the sprite name in the game. When setting a `sprite_index` in your custom level, use the string `"spr_lv23_activated"`.

spr_lv23_activated_**14**.png

This part refers to the frame of animation. You can set this in your custom level using the `image_index` variable.
